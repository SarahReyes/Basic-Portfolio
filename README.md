This assignment was very challenging, but also really fun!

I followed the instructions to the best of my ability.

You will notice that I mostly used individual IDs in my CSS, and very few Classes. This was due to me not fully understanding how to use Classes until I was near the end of the assignment. I ran out of time to go back and clean up the CSS by using Classes.

I also added Google Fonts. There are three total Google Fonts used on my web pages.

I made the "About", "Portfolio", and "Contact", actually link to each other.

I used the pseudo classes that we learned to give those links a hover color, and also a different click color.

I played around with a little drop shadow on my profile picture.

I plan to utilize Classes and combine things more in my next project so the CSS isn't so messy/long.
